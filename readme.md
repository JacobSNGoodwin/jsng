# JSNG Ghost Blog Theme

## A starter blog theme for ghost using parcel bundler and browsersync

Upgraded to work on Ghost 2.* with embedded content and various image sizes!

Uses
* scss
* font awesome
* reframe.js for embedded videos

To get started after installing all packages

```
npm run start
```

See a live demo at: [my blog](www.jacobsngoodwin.com).

_Note that there still seem to be some hickups with SCSS imports in parcel in Windows. Reading forums, these should have be fixed in 1.9.4, but I am still ahving issues on Windows, but not on Mac. For this reason, I recommend running this on Mac_

_Note that there are also parcel issues with experimental tree shaking and minification. I manually minify assets after build_
